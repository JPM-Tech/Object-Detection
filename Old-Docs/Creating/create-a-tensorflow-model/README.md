# Creating a model from a .weights file
\## Step 1. Download this repo
Once the repo is downloaded to your local machine, use your terminal to "cd" into the repos location on your computer.

### Hint
If you use a Mac, type
```
cd
```
into the terminal, then drag and drop the folder for the repo onto the terminal

## Step 2. Run the script
In your terminal, run the following command
```
python3 create_tf_model.py
```

It will ask you for the path to the .weight file, and will create a TensorFlow model from that .weights file.

Then it will open the folder that holds the .pb (TensorFlow) file.
