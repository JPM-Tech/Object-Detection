# Object Detection Easy Button

## Installation
Installation is simple, just download the repo, cd into the main directory, and run the following command to get started:
```
python3 object-detection-easy-button.py
```
Then follow the prompts on the screen

## What can this script do?
With this script, you can... 
1. Train a machine learning model from scratch using your own custom labeled images
2. Download pre-labeled images from Googles Open Images Dataset
3. Train a model on your local computer or using Google CoLab


### Why would you do this?
If you are like me and just want to make an object detection model, without getting a masters degree in machine learning to do it, this is the repo for you.

All the code is open source and broken up into small chunks so that it is easy to follow if you want to read through the code.





## Credits
Most of this code came from the great work done by [The AI Guy](https://github.com/theAIGuysCode) who also has a great [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrydcKaojc44XnuXrfhlV8Q) that you should subscribe to.
